Thank you for visiting my blog! I'm Chongho, originally from South Korea and currently live and work in San Francisco Bay area.
I've been working as a user experience / product designer for the past 8 years and recently started dabbling in coding.

### More about me

- I love drinking tea in [Gong Fu style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gongfu_tea_ceremony).
- I like to read books and watch movies. I'll probably write about them a lot on this blog.
- I also like to make illustrations, animations or motion graphics videos. You'll get to see some of them on this blog.
