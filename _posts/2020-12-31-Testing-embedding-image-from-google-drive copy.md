title: Testing embedding of an image from Google Photos
---

Just realized that my images folder in the repository will exceed the limit (1 GB) at some point. Since I plan to add lots of images (diagrams or artistic compositions etc.) to my posts, I have to find a more scalable solution. Here I'm trying out Google Photos to see if I can embed an image in a my public Google Photo album.

Aaaand... it works! üòç
