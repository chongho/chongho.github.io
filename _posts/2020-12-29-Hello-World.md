Thanks to [Barry Clark's instructions in Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) I've set up my Jekyll Blog on Github in a few minutes. 🙏

It's amazing to have this free blogging platform and so thankful to everyone who made this possible. As much as I want to check in codes everyday, I will also do my best to post my blog posts as often as possible. Let's do this! 💪
